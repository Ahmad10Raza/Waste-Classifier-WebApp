## Demo

You can check out a live demo of the Waste Classifier Web App [here](https://example.com/your-demo).

## Features

- **Waste Classification**: Upload an image of waste, and the application will classify it into predefined waste categories, such as recyclables, non-recyclables, organic, etc.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The web app features an intuitive user interface for easy image uploads and instant results.

- **Customizable**: You can customize the waste categories and retrain the model with your data to better suit your needs.

- **Fast and Efficient**: The application is built using TensorFlow, ensuring fast and accurate waste classification.

## Installation

To run the Waste Classifier Web App on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ahmad10Raza/Waste-Classifier-WebApp.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Waste-Classifier-WebApp
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Start the Flask application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

Your app should now be running locally. Visit `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser to access the web application.

## Usage

1. Access the web app by visiting `http://localhost:5000` in your browser or by navigating to your deployed application URL.

2. Click the "Upload Image" button and select an image of the waste item you want to classify.

3. Click the "Classify" button, and the application will provide you with the waste category for the uploaded image.

4. You can also explore additional features and customization options within the web app.

## Model Training

If you want to train your own waste classification model, you can follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset with waste images and labels.

2. Modify the model architecture and training parameters in the `train_model.py` script.

3. Train the model using your dataset.

4. Replace the pre-trained model in the web app with your newly trained model.
